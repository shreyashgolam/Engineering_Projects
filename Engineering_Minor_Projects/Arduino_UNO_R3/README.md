# Custom PCB Design for Arduino UNO R3 Using Altium

## Project Overview
This project focuses on designing a custom **Arduino UNO R3** PCB using **Altium Designer**. The goal is to create a customized and optimized PCB layout while maintaining compatibility with the standard Arduino UNO R3 form factor. The design incorporates improvements for enhanced performance, reduced noise, and better power management.

## System Architecture
The PCB is designed as a standalone development board with:
- **Microcontroller**: ATmega328P
- **Power Management**:
  - 5V and 3.3V voltage regulators
  - Reverse polarity protection
  - Improved power distribution for stable operation
- **USB-to-Serial Communication**:
  - CH340G/FT232RL for USB-UART bridge (Updated for ATmega16)
  - Bootloader programming support
- **I/O Interfaces**:
  - 14 Digital I/O pins (6 PWM outputs)
  - 6 Analog input pins
  - ICSP header for in-system programming
  - Additional breakout headers for extended functionality
